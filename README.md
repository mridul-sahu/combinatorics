# combinatorics
Some combinatorics algorithms implementations.

# Overview
This repo has various combinatorics related algorithms implemented in C++.

# List of algorithms:
  - **Generate Permutation** : Given a number n, it generates all possible permutations of the set {1,2....,n-1,n}.
  - **Inversion Sequence for Permutation** : Given a permutation of the set {1,2....,n-1,n}, it returns its inversion sequence.
  - **Is Valid Inversion** : Given an inversion sequence of a permutaion to the set {1,2...,n-1,n}, checks if it is a valid inversion sequence.
  - **Get Permutation from Inversion** : Given an inversion sequence, returns its unique permutation.
